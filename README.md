PHPUGHH / SfUGHH meeting topics
===================================
This repository serves for finding topics for the combined Meetup meetings of the [PHP user group Hamburg](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/phpughh/) and the [Symfony user group Hamburg](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/sfughh/).

Topics should be submitted as **issues**. We are open to **both offers and requests** – please use the appropriate issue labels for this purpose. Posting an offer does not mean you commit yourself to giving a “full-featured” talk (unless you want to, of course), but we also are happy to receive offers from people who think they can *contribute* something to a topic, for instance, in a roundtable-like event format.

While issues in this repository should be written in English, talks do not necessarily have to be in English. If you would like to give a talk, but do not feel comfortable with speaking English in public, simply do it in German. In any case, please include information on your preferred language(s) in the issue.

Obviously, you will need a GitHub account to submit issues, but since the meetings are targeted mainly at developers, we are confident that this will not be a problem.

If you have **questions**, please do not hesitate to contact us. You will find contact information on the Meetup pages mentioned above.
